## üìñ Overview

The **Apps Script Requirements Generator** is designed to streamline the initial phase of project development. It provides an intuitive interface for defining project goals, adding various script components, specifying non-functional requirements, and generating a clean Markdown summary.

This tool ensures all key aspects of your script are considered and documented in a consistent, professional format, saving you time and preventing scope creep.

## ‚ú® Features

* üéØ **Project Goal Definition:** Clearly state the primary objective of your Apps Script project to keep your development focused.

* üèóÔ∏è **Component-Based Building:** Use dedicated buttons to quickly add pre-defined components to your specification:
    * **Workflows:** Define the core sequences of actions, containing steps like Data Processors or Report Generators.
    * **Data Processing:** Specify logic for transforming, cleaning, validating, or aggregating data.
    * **Triggers & UI:** Configure time-based triggers, custom menus, and sheet-based operations with ease.
    * **Communication:** Outline email notifications and reporting tasks.
    * **Formulas:** Define complex, context-aware formula calculations.

* ‚ö° **Dynamic & Interactive UI:**
    * **Templates:** Jumpstart your specification with pre-built templates for common scenarios.
    * **Drag & Drop:** Easily reorder components and steps to match your desired logic flow.
    * **Collapsible Sections:** Keep your workspace tidy by collapsing component cards.
    * **Dynamic Linking:** Link workflows to triggers or menu items using convenient dropdowns.

* ü§ñ **AI-Powered Enhancement (Simulated):** Use the `‚ú® Enhance` button to turn your simple notes into more structured, professional specifications.

* üìù **Real-time Markdown Generation:**
    * Watch your `requirements.md` file build itself in real-time as you add and edit components.
    * Toggle between a raw **Markdown** view and a rendered **Preview** that looks just like a GitHub README.

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Launch the App:** Open `index.html` in your browser. For the best experience, use a local server (like the VS Code Live Server extension).
2.  **Define the Project Goal:** Write a concise sentence describing what you want your script to achieve.
3.  **Add Components:** Use the component buttons (`+ Workflow`, `+ Custom Menu`, etc.) or a **Template** to start building your spec.
4.  **Fill in the Details:** Populate the cards with your project's details. Name your workflows, describe data logic, and define UI elements.
5.  **Build Complex Structures:** Nest steps inside a **Workflow** or link **Menu Items** to actions you've defined. Don't forget to drag and drop to reorder!
6.  **Specify Other Requirements:** Check the boxes for non-functional needs like "Performance Optimization" or add custom notes.
7.  **Review & Export:** Toggle between the **Raw** and **Preview** tabs to review the output. When you're happy, click **Copy** or **Download** to get your specification file.

## üî¨ Key Functionality Explained

The application logic is organized into several JavaScript modules (`js/*.js`) for maintainability.

* `addFeature(type)`: Creates and appends a new top-level feature card (e.g., Workflow, Custom Menu) to the UI.
* `addStep(selector)` / `addUIElement(selector, type)`: Adds specific steps or UI elements within their parent cards.
* `updateMarkdown()`: The core function that reads all data from the UI and compiles it into the final Markdown output. It's triggered by nearly every user action.
* `triggerAutosave()` & `checkForAutosave()`: Manages the automatic saving and restoration of the project state to `localStorage`.
* `saveProject()` & `loadProject()`: Handles user-initiated saving and loading of named projects.
* **Dynamic Template Objects:** `featureTemplates` and `stepTemplates` are JS objects that store HTML string templates for each UI component, making the UI easy to manage and extend.
* **Modular Structure:** The code is split into modules like `js/main.js`, `js/templates.js`, and `js/markdown.js` to separate concerns and improve code clarity.
